"efficiency_perspective": "The data is efficient for LLM use because it utilizes a strict, hierarchical namespace (system, sensors, transactions, metrics) which reduces the 'search space' for the model during retrieval. The most significant efficiency gain comes from the 'summary' object; by providing pre-calculated aggregates (total_readings, error_rate), it prevents the LLM from having to perform token-heavy arithmetic over long arrays, which is a common failure point for large datasets. While the 'logs' array is repetitive and slightly bloats the context window, the overall consistency of the keys ensures that the model can maintain a stable internal representation of the schema even as the sequence length increases."
