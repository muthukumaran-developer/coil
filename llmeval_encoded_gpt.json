  "structural_understandability": {
    "score": 7.5,
    "description": "The top-level structure remains clean and modular (system, sensors, transactions, metrics, logs, summary). However, internal table compression shifts structure from native JSON objects to encoded strings, requiring an extra cognitive decoding step for the model."
  },
  "readability_for_machine_reasoning": {
    "score": 7.0,
    "description": "Once the META and BODY conventions are learned, reasoning becomes pattern-driven and consistent. Still, reasoning depends on correctly interpreting ORDER, vmap, and positional fields rather than direct semantic tokens."
  },
  "ease_of_extracting_values": {
    "score": 6.5,
    "description": "Value extraction is deterministic but indirect. The model must resolve column order, decode vmap symbols, and split rows, increasing parsing complexity compared to direct key-value access."
  },
  "context_window_efficiency": {
    "score": 9.5,
    "description": "Repeated keys and verbose JSON objects are eliminated. Columnar encoding, symbol reuse, and dense rows dramatically reduce token count, maximizing usable context for long sequences."
  },
  "schema_clarity": {
    "score": 8.5,
    "description": "Schemas are explicitly declared via META ORDER definitions. This makes the schema unambiguous and stable across rows, even though it is separated from the data itself."
  },
  "risk_of_hallucination": {
    "score": 8.0,
    "description": "Explicit ordering, fixed row width, and symbolic mappings constrain the model’s degrees of freedom. Hallucination risk is lower than verbose JSON, though errors may occur if META is ignored or misapplied."
  },
  "reasoning_stability_on_large_scale_data": {
    "score": 8.5,
    "description": "Columnar regularity and repetition strongly favor stable aggregation, trend detection, and statistical reasoning across large datasets without drifting interpretations."
  },
  "matching_and_aggregation_reliability": {
    "score": 9.0,
    "description": "Uniform row schemas, stable identifiers, and compact representations make joins, grouping, and aggregations highly reliable once decoded, especially at scale."
  },
  "overall_efficiency_summary": {
    "assessment": "LLM-optimized, schema-first, token-efficient representation",
    "insight": "This format trades some immediate readability and extraction simplicity for major gains in context efficiency, large-scale reasoning stability, and aggregation reliability. It is well-suited for LLM pipelines where token budget and scale dominate over human readability."
