  "efficiency_perspective": "This representation is highly efficient regarding token density and context window conservation. By utilizing a custom 'V-Map' (Value Mapping) and a serialized 'BODY' string instead of standard JSON objects, it drastically reduces repetitive keys and syntax overhead. This allows the LLM to process thousands of records within a single context window that would normally be exhausted by traditional JSON. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of reasoning stability; the model must keep the mapping 'V1=NETBANKING' in active attention while parsing the serialized string, increasing the risk of 'index-shifting' hallucinations during high-load extraction."
